# Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Prediction System

ðŸ«€ Live Demo On Streamlit -  https://cardiovascularprediction-jc78xmh2kjldht53ac2juf.streamlit.app/


This project is a machine learning system that predicts the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on patient health data. The goal is to provide an early-warning tool that can help in identifying potential risks and supporting healthcare decisions.


## Features
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Implementation of Random Forest and other ML models
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Cross-validation for performance stability
- Save and load trained models using Joblib


## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, joblib, matplotlib  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest, Logistic Regression (extendable)  
- **Dataset:** UCI Statlog Heart Disease Dataset


## Results
- Achieved high accuracy on test data using Random Forest  
- Demonstrated consistent performance across different random samples  


## Future Improvements
Develop a Streamlit-based dashboard for real-time predictions  
- Compare results with deep learning approaches  
- Deploy as a simple and interactive web application
